probability
    basic probability
    join probability
        in the join probability independent probability we can multiply
    conditional probability p(A|B) the probability conditionally independent
        example
        p(rain | cloudy)  = p(rain and cloudy)
                            ----------------
                                p(cloudy)
        example based on day
            rainday = 105
            totalday = 365
            cloudyday =250
                                    105/365
                                ----------------
                                    250/365

base theorem
    general formula for conditional probability
        conditional probability p(A|B) the probability conditionally independent
        example
        p(rain | cloudy)  = p(rain and cloudy)
                            ----------------
                                p(cloudy)
     based bayes theorem
        p(rain | cloudy)  = p(rain | cloudy) p(rain)
                            ---------------------
                                p(cloudy)
